<h1>Calculator</h1>
This version will do basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It also supports squaring, square root, percentage and parentheses. It reads the input as text that will be translated into a mathematic calculation. 

<h2>What is this?</h2>
A calculator seemed like a nice challenge to improve my coding skills.

<h2>Status of the project</h2>
I started working on the calculator in January 2024. Been doing it occasionally since then.

Added percentage and made the application bigger. Now 15 digits should be visible in the display without resizing it. Unfortunately it's possible to type more. The number of digits should be limited. Haven't had time to fix the details but overall the calculator works fine. There is a runnable JAR file in the test map.It's a nice lightweight application when you quickly need to calculate something.

Negative values. For instance -4+3 or 2--2 will be calculated correctly. It's possible to type the wrong format. Which doesn't crash the application but gives the wrong result. Can be confusing. Need to work on the user-friendliness. Decimals now have up to 10 digits. Can continue to calculate from the last result.

It will automatically select open or closed parenthesis depending on what was previously written.

<h3>2024-04-02</h3>
In this version the calculator will accept just a number or something like the  square root of (16) or (((16))).

<h3>2024-04-01</h3>
The current version (1 April 2024) can do basic arithmetics, square root, understands priority rules and parentheses. One problem is that it doesn't know how to handle single numbers without arithmetics. The square root of (2+2) works fine but not the square root of (4). Negative numbers is another important function that needs to be implemented.

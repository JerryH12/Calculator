<h1>Calculator</h1>
This version will do basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It can also calculate with parentheses, although this will need further development. 

<h2>What is this?</h2>
A calculator seemed like a nice challenge to improve my coding skills.

<h2>Status of the project</h2>
I started working on the calculator in January 2024. Been doing it occasionally since then.

It will automatically select open or closed parenthesis depending on what was previously written.

In this version the calculator will accept just a number or something like the  square root of (16) or (((16))).

<h3>2024-04-01</h3>
The current version (1 April 2024) can do basic arithmetics, square root, understands priority rules and parentheses. One problem is that it doesn't know how to handle single numbers without arithmetics. The square root of (2+2) works fine but not the square root of (4). Negative numbers is another important function that needs to be implemented.
